## Installation

Click on [this URL](https://sivelos1.github.io/I-Need-A-New-Password/) to visit the page.

## Usage


Click the URL to open the webpage. There will be a large, red button labeled 'Generate Password'. Clicking it will generate a secure password for you. Below the red button, there are four customization options for you to mess around with. 'Length' has a number selection box that lets you choose a number between 8 and 128 that determines how many characters your generated password will have. 'Include Upper Case' has a checkbox that determines if your password can have a capital letter. 'Include Special Characters' has a checkbox that determines if your password can include characters such as !, ?, or }. Lastly, 'Include Numbers' has a checkbox that determines if your password can have numbers in it. Disabling the last three options should generate a password of random, lower-case letters.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to create an Issue on the application's GitHub repo or contact me in another fashion.

## Tests

Please generate passwords with varying configuration settings to ensure they work. Please note that the 'Include Upper Case', 'Include Special Characters', and 'Include Numbers' settings do not guarantee that such symbols will appear in your password, only that they CAN appear. You may have to generate several passwords to ensure that such symbols do appear in passwords. If they do not, please make note of which settings don't function and please get in touch or create an issue on the github repo.
